You are analyzing a Google Street View image of a residential property to assess its potential for distressed property acquisition.

TASK: Evaluate this property and assess the probability that it is a good candidate for acquisition based on visual indicators of distress.

SCORING SYSTEM:
- Scale: 0-100
- Higher scores indicate stronger candidates for acquisition
- Score represents cumulative evidence of property distress and owner motivation to sell

EVALUATION CRITERIA:

1. STRUCTURAL AND EXTERIOR DECAY (HIGH WEIGHT):
   Look for:
   - Boarded windows or doors
   - Missing, damaged, or sagging roof shingles
   - Sagging roofline
   - Broken or missing gutters and downspouts
   - Cracked or crumbling visible foundation
   - Peeling or missing siding or stucco
   - Broken windows
   - Severely faded or damaged paint

2. LANDSCAPE AND GROUNDS (MEDIUM WEIGHT):
   Look for:
   - Dead trees or large branches on property
   - Debris, junk, or abandoned items in yard
   - Abandoned appliances or materials visible
   - Broken or significantly leaning fence sections
   - Driveway with significant cracks, potholes, or missing asphalt
   - Weeds growing through walkway or driveway cracks
   - Overgrown grass and shrubbery

3. ABANDONMENT AND VACANCY SIGNALS (HIGH WEIGHT):
   Look for:
   - No visible vehicles in driveway
   - Accumulated newspapers or packages
   - Faded or sun-damaged items visible through windows
   - Visible mold or water stains on exterior
   - No electric service (dark/no lighting visible)
   - Excessive mail accumulation in mailbox
   - Posted foreclosure or abandonment notices

4. UTILITY AND MAINTENANCE (MEDIUM WEIGHT):
   Look for:
   - No visible HVAC units or non-functional units
   - Disconnected or hanging electrical/utility lines
   - Overgrown AC condenser unit suggesting non-use
   - Visible mold or water damage on exterior

5. NEIGHBORHOOD CONTEXT (LOW-TO-MEDIUM WEIGHT):
   Look for:
   - Adjacent properties also showing neglect
   - Multiple properties on same block with similar distress
   - Signs of neighborhood decline

SCORING GUIDELINES:
- Multiple indicators significantly increase the score
- High-weight indicators (structural decay, vacancy signals) are more important
- Single indicators warrant lower scores
- Be conservative: if uncertainty exists, note it but do not assume distress
- Boarded windows + no vehicles + excessive mail is stronger than overgrown landscaping alone

RECOMMENDATION LEVELS:
- "strong_candidate" (70-100): Multiple high-weight indicators, likely motivated seller
- "moderate_candidate" (40-69): Some distress indicators present
- "weak_candidate" (15-39): Few indicators, uncertain opportunity
- "not_a_candidate" (0-14): No significant distress visible
